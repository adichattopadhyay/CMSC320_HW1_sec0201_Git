Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging takes two divergent branches and merges these branches together in a new commit which safeguards the history of both branches. Rebasing is moving/combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Basically taking one branch and reapplying the changes on another. This makes the commit history more linear, but it doesn't safeguard the history.
